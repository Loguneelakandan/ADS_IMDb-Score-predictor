#IMDB SCORE PREDICTIOR

Project Overview

Provide a brief overview of the project and its purpose. Explain that the goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts IMDb scores based on specific features. You can mention that IMDb scores are a measure of a movie's popularity and critical reception, and the predictor can be used to estimate the potential score of a movie before its release.

Installation

Imports the necessary libraries:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis

numpy for numerical computations

sklearn for machine learning tasks (train-test split and standard scaling)

plotly.express for creating interactive visualizations

matplotlib.pyplot for creating static visualizations

Execution Notes

Ensure ' NetflixOriginals.csv' ' is available in the specified location for successful execution.

Update Python and library versions if required for proper functioning

Reads a CSV file named NetflixOriginals.csv using `pandas

-The data is encoded using the 'latin-1' encoding.

Dataset Description

Provide information about the IMDb dataset used in the template. Describe the source of the dataset, its format (CSV, Excel, etc.), and the columns it contains. You can mention the different feature included in the dataset, such as Title, Genre, Premiere, Runtime, IMDB Score, Language .Include a sample of the dataset to give users an idea of its structure.

Dataset

Source: The dataset 'NetflixOriginals.csv' contains historical movie data from NetflixOriginals from 2014 to 2021

Description: The dataset comprises columns such as Title, Genre, Premiere, Runtime, IMDB Score, Language

Usage

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to prepare the dataset, modify the code to fit the specific dataset, and run the code to train the model and make predictions. Include any additional information or considerations, such as data preprocessing steps or model evaluation.

To use this code:

Ensure that the necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, plotly, and matplotlib) are installed in your Python environment.

Update the file path in the pd.read_csv() function to point to the location of your NetflixOriginals.csv file.

Adjust the test size in the train_test_split function if desired.

Run the code to load the data, perform data analysis, and split the dataset.

Review the printed outputs and visualizations to understand the dataset and the split.

Results and Evaluation

Describe how to interpret the results and evaluate the performance of the IMDb score predictor. Explain the meaning of metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and how to interpret the values obtained. Provide guidance on how to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions made by the model.

Results and Outputs

Outputs such as cleaned datasets, trained model parameters, and evaluation metrics will be displayed or saved within the respective notebooks
